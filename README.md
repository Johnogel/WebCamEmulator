# Setup

To generate accounts you can execute *setup.sh* in the *Utilities* directory.

The script will generate a file named *data.json* with a list of username and passwordHash pairs

In order to use the data.json file, you must place it in the *DAL* directory. There should already be file with that name there by default.

Here's an example of what you will see in the console when executing the script (including input):

```Do you wish to clear data (y/n)y
Username (Enter nothing to exit):Test

Password: 
Password (Confirm): true

Username (Enter nothing to exit):```

password is hidden as usual. 

You can modify various settings in the website's root in the *config.json* file.

Setting names should be self explanatory.
